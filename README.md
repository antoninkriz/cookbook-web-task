# Ackee Cookbook Android Version

Welcome, stranger! Wanna join us at [Ackee][1]? Or you just don't know what to do on a lazy sunday afternoon ?

We have a tasty Task for you! Create a JavaScript version of our delicious Ackee recipes. We have everything you need to get you started
- API (and a running server)
- Designs
- Simple React + Redux + Webpack skeleton with all assets

## API & Server
Documentation for the api can be found on [apiary][2] and the
live server runs at this address [https://cookbook.ack.ee][3]

## Designs
Application should contain these 3 screens. You can also download a Sketch app file over [here][4]

- List of recipes
- Form to add a new recipe (via the plus button)
- Detail of a recipe with rating (on a list item click)

### Tasks for you

We slightly recommend you to use our React + Redux + Webpack skeleton but you can use whatever framework you want. *The result should be a frontend app running in a browser.*

- Write the app.
- Use JavaScript to access API and to modify DOM.
- Use mobile first CSS design pattern to create a look of the app.
- The app should run in common browsers (i.e. you don't have to support IE10 and lower).
- The user should be able to rate a recipe only once (user = browser).
- If you want to add anything extra, just go for it!
- Send it to us as link to dropbox / GDrive / etc..
